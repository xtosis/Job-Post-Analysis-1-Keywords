Situated along the shores of the St. John River, Fredericton is uniquely divided by the river into distinct north and south ends. As summer rapidly approaches, the city offers a multitude of activities to enjoy, including 120km of walking trails, Odell Park (known as one of Canada’s best old growth forests), and the famous Fredericton Boyce Farmer’s Market which residents look forward to every Saturday morning (pictured above left).\n</p><p>The city has a strong appreciation of arts and culture, perhaps most evident in the downtown centre which is home to the Historic Garrison District (a national and provincial historic site) and several art galleries, including the Beaverbrook Art Gallery. Whether you live in the heart of the city, or on the outskirts, Fredericton has something for everyone and is a short drive away from other attractions in the province, including provincial and national parks and beaches (Hopewell Rocks Provincial Park pictured right, just over 2 hours from Fredericton). Additional events and attractions can be found at https://www.tourismfredericton.ca/en.</p>\n<p>\nThe Atlantic Transportation and Infrastructure team currently comprises 93 employees spread over the four provinces. WSP’s Fredericton office is in the city’s uptown on the south side, nearby residential areas and shopping centres. As an office with under 50 staff members, our location offers the opportunity for employees to work as part of a close team, receive one-on-one training and mentorship, as well as collaborate with different business lines. Our Municipal Transportation and Infrastructure team members come from a variety of backgrounds and experience ranging from EITs to senior engineers with over 30 years of experience. It is this diversity of skills that have allowed our office to successfully pursue projects. We are eager to add new skills to our team and grow WSP’s Fredericton office!</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nRESPONSIBILITIES</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Preliminary and detailed design of bridges, culverts, retaining walls, and other civil structures;</li>\n<li>Bridge inspections, assessment, and rehabilitation design;</li>\n<li>Quantities and construction cost estimates;</li>\n<li>Checking of designs and drawings;</li>\n<li>Specifications and contract document preparation;</li>\n<li>Review of shop drawings;</li>\n<li>Contract administration;</li>\n<li>Preparation of reports and proposals;</li>\n<li>Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior and intermediate structural engineers and technologists;</li>\n<li>Develop and maintain ongoing client relationships;</li>\n<li>Other duties as assigned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>QUALIFICATIONS</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Professional Engineer or eligible for Professional Engineer in the province of New Brunswick, with 5-10 years demonstrated experience in the area of structural design and bridge engineering in Canada or North America;</li>\n<li>Superior technical understanding and design abilities on current bridge technologies;</li>\n<li>Working knowledge of structural analysis software used in bridge and structural design;</li>\n<li>Specific areas of expertise required are in the planning, preliminary, and detailed design, and construction of bridges of standard and complex geometry, and culverts.
