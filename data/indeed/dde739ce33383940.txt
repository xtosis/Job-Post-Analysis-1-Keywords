['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><h4 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>The Company You’ll Join</b></h4>\n<p>\nAt Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.</p>\n<p>\nWe live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.</p>\n<p>\nAt Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.</p>\n<p>\nTo learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.</p>\n<h4 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nThe Team You’ll Work With</b></h4>\n<p>\nOur mission is to enable data-driven decisions and products across Carta by collecting accurate data, building scalable infrastructure and delivering advanced analytics.
