The Board is committed to providing a workplace environment that is fair and equitable to all.\n<br><br>\nWe believe that having employees who reflect the diversity of our students and our municipalities makes us a stronger Board.\n<br><br>\nWhere the required skills, ability and qualifications of candidates are relatively equal, candidates who self-identify as a member of one or more under-represented groups will be selected.\n<br><br>\nIn our efforts to ensure an inclusive, diverse and representative workforce, HDSB will:\n<br><br>\nvalue, promote and encourage the hiring of staff from under-represented communities;\n<br><br>\nvalue applicants’ additional experiences, lived experience, skills, backgrounds and perspectives\n<br><br>\ncollect voluntary self identification data from applicants in accordance with the Ontario Human Rights Code, HDSB’s Teacher Hiring Practices Administrative Procedure, and Ontario’s Anti Racism Data Standards:\n<br><br>\nWhere the required skills, ability and qualifications of candidates are relatively equal, candidates who self-identify as a member of one or more under-represented groups will be selected.\n<br><br>\n<b>Accommodation:</b><br>\nUpon request, we will provide reasonable accommodations for candidates who have temporary or permanent disability, or who otherwise require accommodations based on the protected grounds highlighted in the Ontario Human Rights Code in respect to the recruitment and selection process.\n<br><br>\n<b>Wellness:</b><br>\nThe HDSB is committed to providing a respectful and healthy work environment.\n<br><br>\nApplicant Self Identification Questions\n<br><br>\nPersonal information on this form is collected under the authority of the Anti-Racism Act, 2017, S.O. 2017, c. 15, in compliance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

It works to intentionally identify and remove barriers for equity-deserving communities at each stage of the hiring process. Encouraging diversity of the workforce in the school board is vital because the workforce should be reflective and representative of the community.\n<br><br>\nAlthough hiring policies must adhere to the qualification requirements set out in applicable Regulation (eg. Regulation 298, “Operation of Schools – General”), the Board recognizes the importance of the following when developing its selection and evaluation criteria:\n<br><br>\nvaluing applicants’ additional experiences, lived experience, skills, backgrounds and perspectives;\n<br><br>\ngranting first consideration, where the skills, ability, and qualifications of the applicants are relatively equal, to applicants who self-identify as members of historically under-represented communities.\n<br><br>\nWe encourage you to complete our voluntary applicant self-identification questions. This data will inform our understanding of the diversity of our applicant pool as well as the progress of applicants throughout the hiring process. This data will inform our goals, strategies and actions and our progress towards creating and sustaining an equitable workforce.\n<br><br>\nThe section includes questions from Ontario’s Anti-Racism Data Standards (Standards, 2017). The Standards were established to help identify and monitor systemic racism and racial disparities within the public sector.
