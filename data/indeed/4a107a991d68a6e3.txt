Staff are responsible for advising their Superiors (Principal/Director/Manager/Supervisor) of unknown risks encountered relating directly to their work.\n</p><p>Staff may be injured by a student as student behaviour can be somewhat unpredictable at times.

For a student with an Individual Program Plan (IPP), staff should also advise the teacher assigned to oversee the IPP of unknown risks encountered. Any plans for working with students who may show aggression whether an IPP or other plan, are evolving plans which may change over time to meet the needs of a particular student at a PSD school.\n</p><p>Staff are expected to cooperate in ensuring workplace health and safety in a caring and respectful educational setting.\n</p><p></p><p>Working Conditions\n</p><ul><li>Working Alone</li><li>Ability to work in various indoor and outdoor weather conditions</li></ul><p></p><p>\nThe scheduled hours to be worked will be determined on an as needed basis.</p><p></p><p>\nAdditional Information\n</p><p>A Casual Caretaker must agree to respect the confidentiality and personal integrity of students, parents, teachers and other staff.\n</p><p></p><p>Hours of Work: will vary</p><p>\nPay Rate: $20.38- $22.81 per hour</p><p></p><p>\nThe successful candidate will be expected to work during the day on all non-instructional days.\n</p><p></p><p>This position requires an original copy of a current clean criminal record check with vulnerable sector and an original copy of a child intervention record check.\n</p><p></p><p>This position is covered by the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local No. 955 Collective Agreement.\n</p><p></p><p>ONLY ONLINE APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED THROUGH APPLY TO EDUCATION WILL BE ACCEPTED.\n</p><p>Applying to a job is a two-step process.
