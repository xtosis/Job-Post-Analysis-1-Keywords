In addition to this, you are expected to be part of the rollout of our new microservices-powered next-generation global platform for monetized content delivery.</div><div></div><div><br>\nAs part of our tribe, you’ll be a key part of the technical decisions and development of both platforms, and as part of a pizza-sized autonomous squad, you are expected to plan, own and drive the development forward.</div><div>\n</div><div><b>\nWhat Your Day To Day Looks Like</b></div><div></div><ul><li><br>\nYou will start your day following scrum rituals where you’ll provide and request updates from your squad in order to identify blockers, align with the sprint goal and move on in an agile matter.</li><li>You take a look at the custom-built AWS health dashboard to make sure nothing is off and you dig a bit into the logs within Datadog, then you create a JIRA ticket as needed.</li><li>Time to open up your IDE and add an enhancement to our existing platform: a form within our platform needs to have additional fields. You expand both the JS code, the CSS, and the PHP linked to it.</li><li>Then, time to jump into the new stuff and become one of the masterminds behind a microservice -powered architecture. You are planning a micro-frontend and thinking about how to publish a library which will provide re-usable components to the tribe.</li><li>After lunch, you make time to review pull requests and provide valuable feedback to your squad team members. Time to talk about “Clean Code”, SOLID principles, Test-Driven-development (TDD) and analyze if the technical solution will scale.</li><li>Every now and then, you’ll join a meeting and talk about user-centric features planned by the Product team and collaborate with them in terms of usability, feasibility, planning and implementation.</li><li>Lastly, you take some time at the end of the day to prepare for the upcoming tribe meeting where you want to showcase a new library that comes in handy to minify the code before we push this to our CDN.</li></ul><div>\n</div><div><b>\nWhat you need to succeed</b></div><div></div><ul><li><br>\nIt helps to have a strong background in PHP and JavaScript and some frameworks and libraries related to these (ideally, Laravel, jQuery and Vue.js) but any other programming background is welcomed as long as you have experience in backend and frontend.</li><li>You believe in the value of tests, be it unit, integration, acceptance or other, and you constantly deliver these alongside high quality and S.O.L.I.D code when needed.</li><li>You can build end to end features without external support, and you are able to think about the functionality, security and scalability of your solution.</li><li>You have some knowledge of AWS services, but mostly, you understand the importance of monitoring and how it fits into your code.</li><li>You are aware of the strong points for microservices, event-driven and serverless architectures, as well as its pain points.</li><li>You value and seek individual contributions and independence, but understand team deliverables have a larger and stronger impact.</li><li>You are perfectly comfortable with a “you build it, you own it” mindset. And you understand your responsibilities continue after you push code to production.</li><li>If you believe you are missing any of the above items, we strongly encourage you to apply as we seek talented individuals that don’t necessarily fit a mold, but rather help us achieve our engineering and company goals.</li></ul><div></div><div><b><br>\n What’s in it for you?</b></div><div>\n</div><ul><li>Work alongside super talented and friendly people that like to drive innovation</li><li>Competitive salary &amp; vacation packages</li><li>Access to 24/7 on demand online healthcare service</li><li>Generous referral program</li><li>Year-round events, from massive to casual and everything in between</li><li>Beautiful office right near Namur metro</li></ul><div>\n</div><div><b>\nYou’ll be Joining:</b></div><div>\n</div><div>\nWe’re DJ’s, video game heroes, photographers, movie buffs, musicians, grill masters and everything in between.
