Do you want to design and build back-end services that route, transform and enrich data from and to devices on a global scale? Come join the AWS Internet of Things (IoT) team, and be part of a revolution!\n<br><br>\nThe Team\n<br>Amazon’s Internet of Things platform (AWS IoT) enables customers to easily and securely connect devices to the AWS cloud using industry standard protocols in a fully managed environment.\n<br><br>\nThe Rules Engine of Amazon’s Internet of Things platform (AWS IoT) enables customers to filter, enrich, process and route data from devices to the full ecosystem of AWS services in a fully managed environment. Companies from all over the world can build their smart features and apps without having to worry about building scalable infrastructure that scales with their message traffic from billions of users and devices – because we do it for them. From simple sensors and actuators that barely have enough memory to run an OS and implement connectivity - to full-blown industrial gateways – they all can benefit from AWS IoT’s Rules Engine to receive, store and process data to implement an ever growing set of features without having to touch the device’s software itself by using the power of the AWS cloud.\n<br><br>\nIf building highly distributed systems, with high-scalability requirements and difficult synchronization problems interest you, we have the right challenge for you! AWS IoT Core is a place you can develop your career while making a direct impact for customers at scale. You will enjoy great benefits, a work environment with innovation engineers, and exciting opportunities to make history, have great fun and be part of the fastest-growing technology company on earth.\n<br><br>\nHere at AWS, we embrace our differences.
