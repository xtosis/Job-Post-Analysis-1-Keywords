['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><p>A BIT ABOUT US<br>Lever was founded eight years ago to tackle the most strategic challenge that companies face: how to recruit and hire top talent. We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Atlassian, KPMG, and McGraw-Hill Education rely on to grow their teams. We\'ve rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale.</p><p>We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture.</p><p>THE CHALLENGE<br>Lever is in heavy growth mode, with the Product and Engineering teams (collectively known as “R&amp;D”) leading the charge. As we continue to scale our team, our business, and our customer base, bolstering our operational rigor is an absolute must-have in order for the R&amp;D team to perform at its highest level and for us to deliver the greatest value to our customers.</p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY<br>The Manager, Product Operations &amp; Enablement is the first of its kind at Lever. At its core, this role bolsters our Product and Engineering teams to build and deliver a best-in-class product that our customers love, and to do so in a way that is efficient, scalable, and constantly improving. This is a player-coach role, managing one team member to start while also directly managing key strategic initiatives.</p><p>You will lead cross-functional projects designed to improve the team’s operational efficiency, consistency, and excellence. You will work on improving and scaling processes, systems, and reporting and analytics — working closely with not only the Product Management and Engineering teams, but also cross-functional stakeholders such as Customer Support, Customer Success, Sales, and IT. You will ensure that R&amp;D is operating as a tight ship, that workflows and communication loops between R&amp;D and other teams in the company are efficient and effective, and that there are simple yet effective mechanisms in place to track, drive, and share out progress for key initiatives.</p><p>You will also manage and coach our Product Launch Specialist, ensuring that as new product offerings are ready for release, appropriate stakeholders across the business (such as Product Marketing and Revenue Enablement) have the right information and training at the right time to communicate effectively to internal and external audiences.</p><p>We are looking for an organized and data-driven professional, who pays close attention to detail, possesses a high degree of business acumen, and can partner effectively with people across teams and levels. This role is perfect for you if you love making processes more efficient, you enjoy solving problems, and you believe operational excellence is the bedrock to business success.</p><p>This role is both highly strategic and very hands-on. You will advise leaders on the best processes to adopt, metrics to monitor, and levers to pull to move the needle; you will also roll up your sleeves to make direct updates to systems, workflows, dashboards, and documentation. Your work will support Product Managers, Engineering leaders, and company leaders in general to make high-quality, data-informed decisions.</p><p>THE TEAM<br>You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things-automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience-and we love sharing those passions with each other.</p><p><b>THE SKILL SET</b></p><ul><li>Minimum 4 years of experience in an operations management, project management, program management, and/or consulting role</li><li>Minimum 4 years of experience building reports, charts, and dashboards that help stakeholders track progress to business goals and take effective action</li><li>Minimum 2 years of people management experience</li><li>Track record building strong partnerships with both technical and non-technical teams</li><li>Familiarity with development/business tools such as Jira, Zendesk, and/or Confluence; openness and ability to learn new tools quickly</li><li>Knowledge of SQL is a strong plus</li><li>Track record driving initiatives forward that involve multiple stakeholders, dependencies, and points of view</li><li>Strong analytical skills: ability to structure analysis and derive data-driven insights end to end</li><li>Strong problem-solving skills: ability to break-down ambiguous problems and turn them into actionable solutions and insights</li><li>Excellent attention to detail and written and verbal communication</li></ul><p><b>WITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU’LL</b></p><ul><li>Complete Ramp Camp, our onboarding program designed to get you up to speed on all aspects of the business with a cross-functional cohort of new Leveroos.
