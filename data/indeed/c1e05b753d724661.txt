Situated along the shores of the St. John River, Fredericton is uniquely divided by the river into distinct north and south ends. As summer rapidly approaches, the city offers a multitude of activities to enjoy, including 120km of walking trails, Odell Park (known as one of Canada’s best old growth forests), and the famous Fredericton Boyce Farmer’s Market which residents look forward to every Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>\nThe city has a strong appreciation of arts and culture, perhaps most evident in the downtown centre which is home to the Historic Garrison District (a national and provincial historic site) and several art galleries, including the Beaverbrook Art Gallery. Whether you live in the heart of the city, or on the outskirts, Fredericton has something for everyone and is a short drive away from other attractions in the province, including provincial and national parks and beaches. Additional events and attractions can be found at https://www.tourismfredericton.ca/en.</p>\n<p>\nThe Atlantic Transportation and Infrastructure team currently comprises 93 employees spread over the four provinces.
