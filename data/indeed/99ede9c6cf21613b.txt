We promote employment equity and encourage you to indicate if you belong to one of the designated groups when you apply.</p><p>\nInformation on employment equity</p>\n<p>Each individual has their own story and candidates come from all walks of life. It is this diversity that makes our workforce stronger. With this in mind, we encourage you to share the experience you have acquired from all aspects of your life. We therefore also welcome examples from your personal experiences, such as your studies, volunteer work, hobbies or any other experience that you consider relevant to the position to be filled.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere is a suggestion to help you explain your examples:<br>\nS = What was the situation or context?<br>\nT = What were your tasks or responsibilities?\n<br>\nA = What actions did you take?\n<br>\nR = What was the result of your actions?<br>\n<br>\nThe screening board cannot make any assumptions about your experience. It is not sufficient to say that you have the required qualifications or to list your current duties. You must answer the screening questions (essential and asset qualification, if applicable) and demonstrate not only that you have the required experience but how, where and when it was acquired while ensuring you provide clear and accurate details/examples. The curriculum vitae will be a secondary source to confirm the experience described in your answers. Applications that do not clearly demonstrate that the candidate meets the screening criteria will not be given further consideration.<br>\n<br>\nAsset qualifications could be used at the screening stage. Please ensure that your resume clearly indicates how you meet each of assets qualifications (education and experience), if applicable. A person may be appointed even though he/she does not meet any or all of the asset qualifications. However, it may be a deciding factor in choosing the person to be appointed.<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that in addition to all assessment methods such as the application, exam and/or the interview, correspondence and communications in relation to this selection process may also be used to assess certain qualifications.<br>\n<br>\nIt is the responsibility of the candidate to notify the Human Resources Advisor of any change regarding your contact information (email, telephone number) and regarding pre-approved leave throughout the duration of the process in order to facilitate scheduling of evaluations. An alternate date will be possible if requested for the following reasons: 1) Medical reasons with doctor’s certificate; 2) Death in your immediate family; 3) Confirmation of pre-approved travel plans or training plans (made before the advertisement posting date); 4) Religious reasons.</p>\n<h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>Preference</b></h2>\n<p>Preference will be given to veterans and to Canadian citizens, in that order, with the exception of a job located in Nunavut, where Nunavut Inuit will be appointed first.</p><p>\nInformation on the preference to veterans</p>\n<p><b>We thank all those who apply.
