Transit agencies need real-time insights to understand what’s happening in their cities — and so do the companies and academic partners that serve them.</p><p>\nAnd then there’s Transit: Where are people booking trips? Where are folks headed? What modes are they taking? Transit network planners would weep at having the data you’ll have access to. You will be tasked with teasing meaning and insight out of all that data — from O-D matrices, to survey analysis — to help our agency and operator partners deliver better service on the ground, while also protecting user privacy with swords and dragons.</p><p>\nIf your brain is wired for cities, if organizing data gives you a dopamine rush, and if improving one of the world’s most highly-used navigation apps would make you feel like a QUEEN at the end of each day, this job is for you. You’ll be trusted to reach elegant, simple conclusions from our big black box of user data, complemented by in-app and in-person research.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\n   Responsibilities</b></h3><p>\nYou’ll draw insights from existing data sources, have input into the way we collect and structure our data, test all the hypotheses (okay not all the hypotheses), create forecasts with that data, and talk data with our partners. You’ll design our in-app surveys and analyze the results.
