Currently there is no single measure showing the ability to predict disease outcome for individuals. Deep learning technologies have shown the promise to extract robust data features and make competitive decisions in disease characterization at an individual level. We have funded projects to investigate the utility of deep learning in promoting disease prediction and treatment in MS, including: 1) prediction of disease progression; 2) prediction of personalized treatment responses; and 3) interpretation of the mechanisms of deep learning.</p><p>\nThe central focus of the positions is to develop novel deep learning methods for the associated studies. The datasets will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, as well as clinical outcomes of the patients. In addition, we have developed techniques to derive pathology-relevant texture features out of MRI, which will also be part of the experiments where applicable. We have now located data from hundreds of patients and have access to high performance computing resources to enable efficient deep learning.</p><p>\nWe are looking for competitive candidates for postdoctoral fellows to conduct independent research for the aforementioned projects (although graduate students in related areas are also needed with compelling stipends). The research will involve intimate collaborations with specialists from diverse fields such as neurology, radiology, medical imaging, and machine learning.</p><p>\nThe postdoctoral scholars will be part of Dr Zhang’s research group. The team focuses on the development and evaluation of novel image processing and analysis techniques, particularly machine learning/deep learning, for advancing personalized disease characterization and treatment capacities.\n</p><p><b>Qualifications:</b></p><ul>\n<li>PhD and/or MD completed within the last 3 years, in fields including (but not limited to) Computer Science, Software Engineering, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, and Neuroscience</li>\n<li>Experience in multidisciplinary MRI research and machine learning is an asset, but strong candidates with minimal associated experience are also encouraged to apply</li>\n<li>Demonstrated excellence in peer-reviewed publications</li>\n<li>Be able to work in a fast-paced environment, juggle and prioritize multiple tasks, and seek assistance when appropriate</li>\n<li>Be mature, responsible, and flexible, and have excellent organizational, problem solving, and people skills</li></ul><p><b>\nApplication Details:</b></p><p>\nInterested applicants should send a cover letter describing research experience and interests, an updated CV, and names and contacts of three references to: yunyzhan@ucalgary.ca.
