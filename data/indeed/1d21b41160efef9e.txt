We innovate everywhere, taking bold risks to shape the technologies that give us smart cities, connected cars, and handheld hospitals. And we do it in style with unique personalities who aren’t afraid to change the way the world works, lives, plays and learns. We are thought leaders, tech geeks, pop culture aficionados, and we even have a few purple haired rock stars. We celebrate the creativity and diversity that fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers.\n<br><br>\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.\n<br><br>\nWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br><br>\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br><br>\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.\n<br><br>\nLI-Remote\n<br>#cie_jobs and #cie_neteng_jobs</div>']
