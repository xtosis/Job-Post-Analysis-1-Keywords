We know it when we see it. Passion is not saying how much you love what you do in your most excited voice. Passion is revealed in your truest self. It\'s about what you\'ve accomplished; how you want to grow; the ideas you have; your philosophies. It\'s demonstrating through your words and your actions that you truly believe in what you do -- and where you work. That it matters to you. And that\'s pretty cool.\n<br><br>\nResourcefulness and application. At Aptos, we have a pioneering spirit -- when we have questions, we find answers; when we\'re faced with challenges, we find solutions. We turn to a variety of resources, including our own colleagues, our professional network, the Internet, articles and books -- whatever helps us get the job done. But it\'s not just about using a variety of resources to gain knowledge -- it\'s also about applying that knowledge to other areas of the job or business where it might make sense.\n<br><br>\nInitiative. You don\'t wait around for things to happen or for your manager to tell you what to do. You\'re not only proactive about completing your own work, but when you sense the need to introduce a project that will benefit the team or the organization -- even if it\'s outside your scope of work -- you put a proposal together, talk to the team about it, and own it . And that also goes back to having a pioneering spirit.\n<br><br>\nDid we pique your interest?\n<br><br>\nIf this sounds like the kind of job you would love in the kind of environment you would thrive in, please drop us a line -- we\'d love to hear from you!</div>']
