Check us out in Fintech Impact, Perkins + Will, Daily Hive, BC Business, our Instagram, and our Blog.</b></p><p><i>We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.</i></p><p>We’re a committed and talented group of diverse people working hard to solve a real, universal problem for millions of entrepreneurs: businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses. Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. We’ve paired smart humans with incredibly powerful software to develop the fastest, most efficient bookkeeping service in history. This lets us provide monthly and yearly financials at an incredibly accessible price, giving business owners the time, confidence, and knowledge they need to be successful.</p><p>Bench is growing fast. Recently, we’ve onboarded our 10,000th client and our 600th employee. We have a clear, funded path to profitability, and a roadmap that we believe will rapidly accelerate the trajectory of our business. We’re looking for the brightest minds who love solving tough problems to join us on this incredible journey, in pursuit of bringing financial mastery to our clients.</p><p><b>Bench’s Customer Testimonial</b></p><p>“ Owning and running a business and not having the skills to do it all... Owning and running a business, raising a family as a single-parent, taking care of aging parents, trying to navigate the challenges in life, anxiety attacks mixed-in with moments of depression, what next!? What was I thinking that I would have the time and know-how to keep up with my financials and all that is required when running a business…? Well, after years of neglect, I was forced to the realization that things will only get worse, I knew I needed help! But I was now more lost and behind than ever…I felt alone! Enter Bench Accounting, the answer to my prayers. Because of my years of neglect, I was forced to seek help. Fast forward, I was soon introduced to Bench Accounting. From the first moment I was introduced to Erin, I knew I finally had someone on my side - a group of professionals that showed the concern for my needs and worries. Needless to say, the experience has been an emotional one for me as it has allowed me to gain back my life in so many ways. Professionals like Maya, whom I have the honor to work with, have taken the time to understand every aspect of my business, stay in constant contact, and deliver quickly to me the financial upkeep that is required for all businesses. More than just providing the expertise and know-how, I feel I have built a relationship with Bench that is personal – real people who care about my well-being. It all makes sense and is simple to me now – focus on what I am best at and allow Bench to take care of the rigors of bookkeeping which ultimately helps me in reaching my goals. And now, I have hope and am able to look forward and not behind. I no longer feel alone. Thank you, Bench Accounting.”</p><p>Patrick H. 9/25/20</p><p><b>What does the Client Success Onboarding department look like?</b></p><p>Our team was created 18 months ago and has been operating in a scrappy environment under the Director of Client Success.
