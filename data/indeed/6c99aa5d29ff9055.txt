We’re tackling a real and complex problem for them—managing supply and demand in the face of constantly changing customer behavior, highly complex supply chain networks, 40-year-old data standards and labor-intensive manual processes.</div><div></div><div><br>\nAlloy is a fast-growing, well-funded startup with expanding offices across the world. Our team hails from successful startups, leading tech companies and Fortune 100 enterprises. We believe deeply in fostering individual ownership, iterating to excellence, focusing on what matters, communicating openly &amp; respectfully, and supporting one another.</div><div></div><div><br>\nWe encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. Alloy is committed to creating an inclusive culture, and we celebrate diversity of all kinds.</div><div></div><div><br>\nAbout the Role</div><div></div><div><br>\nOur Platform Engineers develop and maintain the infrastructure and tools that keep Alloy running and empower our team. They are responsible for observability (logging, monitoring, etc.), disaster recovery, security, and scalability.</div><div></div><div><br>\nAs a key member of the development team, you’ll work with Alloy\'s other engineering teams to establish conventions, implement best practices, and improve performance.<br>\n</div><div></div><br>\n<div>Platform Engineers own the infrastructure on which Alloy runs. This means writing plenty of code and contributing to internal and external tools, integrations between systems, and the product itself.</div></div>\n<div><div><h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>In this role, you will:</b></h3><ul><ul><li>\nDesign and improve infrastructure that scales with us, without getting in the way.</li><li>\nWriting clean code that performs well at scale.</li><li>\nImplement observability and security best practices.</li><li>\nManage our production, testing environments, CI/CD pipelines, disaster recovery strategy, etc.</li><li>\nExtend our platform to enable integration with customer and third-party systems.</li><li>\nBuild developer tools that streamline our engineering workflows and empower the engineering team.</li></ul></ul></div></div>\n<div><div><h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>You’ll be a great fit at Alloy if:</b></h3><ul><ul><li>\nYou love to automate everything.</li><li>\nYou know that the infrastructure must suit the product.

Work hard in a way that is sustainable. Choose the schedule that lets you achieve your best. Measure results, not hours. Respect your time and that of others; come prepared and leave with commitments.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nTake ownership:</b> Take initiative by proactively identifying opportunities or issues and tackling them. Strive for excellence. Hold yourself and your colleagues to a high standard. Create something that makes you proud. Follow through on our commitments to customers, users, and each other. We are all doers, regardless of role — no task is beneath you.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nIterate to excellence:</b> Prefer action over perfection to learn quickly from early feedback. Be flexible and accept the need to make tradeoffs and change directions. Everything is a work in progress, nothing is done. Question prevailing assumptions, but understand them first. Gather evidence and champion ideas that will make our products and our company better. Verify and validate.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nCommunicate openly and respectfully: </b>Offer and expect transparency to build trust. Confirm mutual understanding, especially in the face of disagreement. Treat each other with respect. Criticize constructively — the work, not the person.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nHave each other’s back</b>: When interacting with each other, always assume good intentions. Trust each other and take risks together. Give praise generously and take joy in others’ accomplishments. Grow a diverse team by actively seeking different backgrounds and cultivating an inclusive culture. Focus on how others’ strengths compliment us, rather than how their weaknesses invalidate them.</div></div></div></div>']
