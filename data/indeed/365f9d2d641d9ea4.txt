Verify and validate.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nCommunicate openly and respectfully: </b>Offer and expect transparency to build trust. Confirm mutual understanding, especially in the face of disagreement. Treat each other with respect.

Grow a diverse team by actively seeking different backgrounds and cultivating an inclusive culture.
