This is a small team that does big things. We operate in dozens of data centers globally and are constantly expanding to offer greater services and more effectively deliver solutions to our customers.\n<br><br>\n<b>Who You\'ll Work With:</b><br>\nThis full-stack engineering team is a mix of engineers who have come from network, systems, and software engineering roles and experiences.\n<br>We work closely with other Cisco Security product engineering teams developing customer facing security services, and with the Cloud Infrastructure Engineering teams building core Internet infrastructure and distributed systems to help deliver the services globally more effectively and efficiently at scale.\n<br>The team invests heavily on continual improvement in automation and optimization. Everything needs to scale horizontally and autonomously with stability, resiliency at a high performance with the flexibility to adapt. We take great pride in building and operating one of the most hyperconnected and highly optimized global anycast networks in the world.\n<br>What You\'ll Do\n<br>As a new member of the team, you are responsible for growth, scale and reliability of our services. The challenges can be significant, and we own these applications end-to-end; architecture, software development, infrastructure and the operational component.

Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!</div>']
