The RO would be someone who shares our core values of Integrity, Excellence, Respect and Creativity. RO activities include the development of proposals for new research initiatives, project management, and providing service to NRC clients. The RO would also provide input into the overall direction and research priorities for program areas within the Research Centre.<br>\n<br>\nTo support the goals of the NRC and ACRD Research Centre, the RO will establish an international calibre research program focused on deciphering the network of interactions occurring in agroecosystems and crop phytobiomes that affect overall productivity. Specifically, the RO’s research should focus on: (1) the integration of various ‘omics datasets from plants, microbes, and environment, and (2) the development of systems and network models that would predict the impacts of agro-ecosystem interactions on crop production and help identify preferred crop genetics. The RO would be expected to translate discoveries into powerful new tools for crop and agroecosystem management. The RO would work in a multi-disciplinary team environment with researchers and technical experts at NRC and would form collaborative research activities within Canada and internationally. It is expected that the RO will provide meaningful contributions to the ACRD Research Centre’s goal of providing solutions that enhance and increase the sustainability and long-term health of Canada’s agricultural production systems encompassing food, feed, and fiber.</p>\n</div></div><div><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nScreening Criteria</b></h2>\n</div><div><p>\nApplicants must demonstrate within the content of their application that they meet the following screening criteria in order to be given further consideration as candidates:</p>\n</div></div><div><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nEducation</b></h2>\n</div><div><p>\nPhD in Bioinformatics, Biology, or other-related discipline with relevant experience in multi-omics data analysis and systems biology studies.
