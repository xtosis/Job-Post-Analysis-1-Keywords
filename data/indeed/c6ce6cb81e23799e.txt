While every BC ministry collects and manages its own data, the Data Innovation Program (DI Program) can securely link and de-identify data from multiple ministries, giving government analysts a better understanding of BC’s complex issues.\n</p><p></p><p>The program supports population-level analysis, not individual or case-level analysis, unlocking the potential for new insights that lead to better programs and services for British Columbians.\n</p><p>Through the Data Innovation Program, existing data sets from various ministries or agencies are linked and de-identified in a secure platform (known as a Secure Research Environment, or SRE) to support specific population-level research projects. These projects aim to better understand trends and complex issues in BC.\n</p><p></p><p>Population Data BC works in partnership with the Data Innovation Program providing services related to data linkage, secure data storage, and project and data management.\n</p><p>The Software Developer will design, implement, and maintain new and existing technologies required to support both Population Data BC’s and the Data Innovation Program’s key objectives. The incumbent will provide project leadership on various technical initiatives, including joint projects between the Data Innovation Program and Population Data BC.<br>\n</p><p><br>\n<b>Organizational Status\n</b></p><p>Population Data BC is based at the School of Population and Public Health (SPPH), which is in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia.
