As a Systems Engineer, you will be a key member of the Platform Service team, supporting containerized internet security services in our globally distributed data centers. Our team is responsible for the networks and hosts that support thousands of Internet-scale services. At its core, the Cloud Infrastructure team provides Infrastructure as a Service for engineering in dozens of our “edge” data centers.\n<br>Who You\'ll Work With\n<br>The Streamline Platform Service team is looking for a Systems Engineer to help us build and operate our globally distributed application platform. We support cloud-native security applications running at internet scale. This team works closely with the rest of the Infrastructure Engineering teams to build core internet architecture, security applications and distributed systems at scale.\n<br>Our team strongly believes in network automation, and we are committed to automating all our repetitive tasks such as configuration management and auto-remediation of incidents. We are a globally distributed team supporting over two dozen data centers servicing thousands of containerized services.\n<br>Who You Are\n<br>You have experience with high-availability compute platforms and understand how to build scalable infrastructure. You have a good understanding of containerization/virtualization technologies and networking concepts. You strive to build systems that are automated and performant. You understand cloud design principles and are comfortable operating in a modern DevOps environment.\n<br><br>\n<b>Some of the things you will work on:</b><br>\nSupport internal Cisco customers by extending existing services and creating new ones\n<br>Design, build and operate highly available security services at scale, using golang, bash, and other languages/tools as fits the situation’s needs\n<br>Develop solutions for networking and orchestration problems with availability, scale and latency in mind\n<br>The ins and outs of supporting a platform running 24x7\n<br>Design, build and improve CI/CD pipelines\n<br>Fine-tune configuration and improve the performance of a variety of systems alongside with your team members\n<br><br>\nThe team could be a good fit for you if some of these apply to you:\n<br>Experience with container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes\n<br>Familiarity with operating a high-transactional, 24x7 production environment\n<br>Some experience with applications that span multiple data-centers and/or cloud controllers\n<br>Experience with systems, network, and application security concepts\n<br>Familiarity with application delivery platforms for load balancing, caching, compression, application firewalling, reverse proxy, SSL termination, etc.\n<br>Familiarity with Agile software development methodologies, Scrum, Kanban\n<br>Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or equivalent engineering experience\n<br><br>\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br><br>\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\n<br>#LI-Remote\n<br>#cie_jobs #cie_neteng_jobs</div>']
