['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Who We Are\n<br>Cisco enjoys a unique position and is leveraging our unprecedented capability to secure the network through intelligence derived from data collected on a global scale. Billions of times a day, computers around the world communicate with the Cisco Advanced Malware Protection Cloud and rely on the AMP product to protect them against advanced forms of malware. Some malware is straightforward to identify, but antivirus has done that forever. Our customers need protection against malware that is tricky to identify, such as: Viruses that generate different binaries on every machine they infect Things that seem benign until you start looking closely at their behavior/pattern Malicious programs that have invented new ways of hiding themselves To make the problem even more interesting - it may only become clear after a few days that a program or behavior was malicious. Does finding that sound fun to you?\n<br>Who You\'ll Work With\n<br>The Cisco AMP engineering team is a collaborative team that is a part of the world’s largest security organization. You will have the opportunity to work in a diverse and thriving work culture that fosters team empowerment, self-organization and decision-making.

Your team will create test frameworks that ensure built-in quality exists from the first line of code to the last.

Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?
