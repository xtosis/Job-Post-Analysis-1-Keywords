['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><p>Acknowledging that UPEI is located on the unceded land of the Mi’kmaq Nation, of the Wabanaki Confederacy, in the traditional district of Epekwitk, the Faculty of Sustainable Design Engineering (FSDE) at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) welcomes applications from exceptional candidates for a tenure-track faculty appointment (academic rank to be determined) to an Industry Research Chair in robotics and automation for a sustainable food industry. Candidates should have expertise in one or more of the following research areas:</p>\n<ul><li>Mechatronics and robotization in the food industry</li>\n<li>Control engineering for food sorting and packaging</li>\n<li>Automatic process control and optimization of thermal and cooling systems</li>\n<li>Smart sensor technology for automated food processing</li>\n<li>Machine vision for food quality control and safety inspection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The successful candidate will be expected to develop and maintain an ongoing, world-class program of research and scholarly work with close collaborations with industry and other relevant partners. The successful candidate is expected to attract significant external funding, to supervise graduate students and other highly qualified personnel, to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses including in our design clinic courses, to contribute to ongoing curriculum development, and to fulfill service obligations to both the Faculty and the University. The successful candidate will benefit from a reduced teaching load and funding for research and scholarly work. Finally, the successful candidate will demonstrate a commitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).</p>\n<p><b>About our Program</b></p>\n<p>The FSDE is committed to developing engineers with exceptional design and professional skills combined with a global perspective — engineers who are broadly capable, globally and socially aware, creative, communicative, and entrepreneurial. Sustainable design engineers are problem solvers. They use design skills, engineering knowledge, math and science to deliver innovative and sustainable solutions to modern-day problems. A sustainable solution is one in which all factors and stakeholders are considered. It goes beyond just providing an innovative, efficient, attractive, on-time, and on-budget solution. It also considers how such goals are achieved and their impact on people, the environment and society. The FSDE aspires to develop and mentor graduates who embody these ideals.</p>\n<p>The teaching model used in the FSDE’s undergraduate program is unique in Canada. It is based on an innovative design clinic model that is integrated throughout all years of the program. In the design clinics, students are immersed in hands-on, project-based, experiential learning while working on real projects for a wide range of people from the community, municipalities, government, industry and others. The program provides students with a solid technical foundation which supports the development of their design skills. As part of the teaching model, the program also demands that students learn and exhibit the professional skills necessary to succeed as an engineer.\n</p><p>The FSDE’s capacity in research and scholarly work and in graduate programming is also rapidly expanding. We currently offer a MSc program in Sustainable Design Engineering and are now working towards a new interdisciplinary PhD program in Sustainable Design Engineering. Faculty members are actively engaged in research and scholarly work with national and international partners with significant support from industry, tri-council funding and other federal funding programs. Much of this activity is highly interdisciplinary in nature and reaches beyond the current focus areas of the undergraduate program: mechatronics, bioresources and sustainable energy.</p>\n<p>The FSDE is housed in a cutting-edge 7,000 square-metre facility specifically designed to foster innovation and industry-university collaboration. With a view of enhancing the student learning experience, the facility represents a move away from the traditional classroom and includes design studios, ideation spaces, well-equipped workshops and laboratories and a large range of supporting staff. To better foster industry collaboration and partnerships, the new facility is home to a number of facilities closely aligned with the FSDE’s three focus areas.</p>\n<p><b>Application Instructions</b></p>\n<p>The successful candidate must have an earned a doctoral degree in an engineering discipline that is closely aligned with robotics and automation for a sustainable food processing industry. Industry experience, or experience gained through collaborative work with industry, including experience in engineering design; collaborative R&amp;D projects; entrepreneurship; technology transfer, licensing and commercialization; and intellectual property, will be considered a strong asset. Additionally, the successful candidate must be eligible for registration as a Professional Engineer (or Engineer-in-Training) in the Province of Prince Edward Island.\n</p><p>Candidates must submit to the individual listed below, a cover letter citing the competition number listed above, a full curriculum vitae, and a list of three (3) referees including an email address for each.
