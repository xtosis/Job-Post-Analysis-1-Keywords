['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Who we are\n<br>At Cisco Umbrella (nee OpenDNS) we provide best-in-class DNS based services globally to internal and external customers. As part of Cloud Infrastructure Engineering we build DNS as infrastructure, offer network security services and operate as a business within Cisco. By working in lock-step with engineering, we enable businesses to securely innovate and protect them from existing and emerging threats.\n<br>What you’ll be doing\n<br>Our engineers have experience running large, distributed systems both on bare metal and on cloud services (bonus points for Amazon Web Services.) Our systems process 250+ BILLION transactions per day! You will join a team that focuses on quality, pragmatic solutions to issues. Operating in an automation first environment, you will work along side our development team to understand the current architecture and moving pieces. We own these applications end-to-end; architecture, software development, infrastructure and the operational component. The challenges can be significant. At times, it may mean rewriting or refactoring of an application in order to automate everything and remove human dependency.\n<br>We are committed to getting it done. Properly. The first time.\n<br>Who you are\n<br>To join the team, we are looking for candidates with a background in Linux/BSD systems and operation at scale. Strong candidates can show skill in networking and automation, preferably with Ansible and Python experience. While it would be great if you already know something about the DNS, as long as you have a basic understanding and ability to learn, we are always happy to teach new team members the ropes. We also want to know that you\'ve been responsible for time-sensitive, mission critical systems with a high attention to detail. Our services are the heart of the Cisco Umbrella product, and we take ownership of that very seriously -- our SLOs are high. You have proven all the vital skills to build and improve these systems over the course of your career -- this isn’t your first rodeo.\n<br><br>\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\n<br><br>\nLI-Remote\n<br>#cie_jobs\n<br>#cie_neteng_jobs</div>']
