Our patented cloud-first Knowledge Engine uses advanced NLP and machine learning to enable continuous learning from content, discussions, case management, and agile development systems. We embrace a human-in-the-loop philosophy to train data sets, refine recommendation quality, and learn from implicit user feedback.</p><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b><br>\nU</b><b>se Cases</b></h2><p>\nThe Peritus Knowledge Engine is currently being deployed for the following use cases at large technology vendors:</p><p></p><ul><li><br>\nCustomer Self-Service: AI-assisted search and forum question-answering automation to avoid new support cases.</li><li>\nSupport Automation: Assisted problem solving that accelerates resolution time and shifts-left new knowledge to make the team smarter.</li><li>\nServices Automation: Build and integrate custom solutions faster by automating code reuse and lower risk of daily CI/CD releases.</li></ul><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nT</b><b>he Peritus Technology Platform</b></h2><p>\nStarting with assisting tech users in quickly finding a needle in the haystack, vision extends to assist human reasoning for complex answers across dynamic sources of information. The company’s technology platform ingests unstructured content, systems of record, and product telemetry at high volume &amp; velocity into an industry specific knowledge graph. We use reinforcement learning and a normalized ontology for people, products, and problems to assist human reasoning during problem solving and actively learn from implicit feedback. Peritus has been granted two patents pertaining to reinforcement learning and using a knowledge graph applied to customer service.</p><p>\nOur team is proudly global with locations in the U.S (Bay Area), India (Bangalore), and Canada.
