['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Create next generation cross-platform developer experiences\n<br><br>\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a new capability in Windows that opens up new possibilities for Linux development and operations in Windows environments. WSL is not a virtual machine system like Hyper-V, nor an operations capability like Docker or Kubernetes, nor a cloud simulator like Multipass. Instead, WSL offers a specific set of capabilities from a Linux environment across to the Windows desktop, allowing for interesting new kinds of integration to take place at that boundary. Use your Windows editors and version control, compile and test on Linux, for example.\n<br><br>\nWe are excited to explore the forefront of these possibilities, helping to shape the future of Windows-and-Linux development.
