As a Research Scientist, you\'ll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more.</p><p>\nAs a Research Scientist, you\'ll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world.</p>\n<p>\nGoogle Research, focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems. Our broad and fundamental research goals allow us to collaborate closely with many different product teams across the company.\n</p><p>\nResearch happens at Google everyday, on many different embedded teams throughout the company. Our research reaches the user through both services and products such as Search, Maps, Google Assistant, Google Translate, Google Cloud and our computing, storage, and networking infrastructure. To achieve this, weâ€™re working on a wide variety of projects that utilize the latest state-of-the-art technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible.</p></div><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>\nResponsibilities</b></h2><ul>\n<li>Participate in cutting-edge research in machine intelligence and machine learning applications.</li>\n<li>Develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.</li>\n</ul></div>Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
