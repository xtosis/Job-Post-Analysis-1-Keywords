We recognize and reward quality results and commitment to our company\'s purposes and principles.\n<br>What You\'ll Do\n<br>You’ll join a highly skilled team of software developers and computer security professionals to design and implement software for Cisco’s Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution. You’re a self-starter who can solve complex problems independently. At the same time, you understand the power of teamwork and believe in dedicating yourself to achieving team goals. You’ll contribute to all aspects of modern software development including requirements gathering, architectural design, coding, test development, root cause analysis, and building Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) infrastructure.\n<br>Minimum requirements\n<br>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a similar field\n<br>Ability to analyze complex problems and effectively communicate technical details\n<br>3+ years of experience developing multi-threaded software using C++\n<br>Experience with CI/CD infrastructure (Jenkins, Chef)\n<br>Experience with version control software (Git)\n<br>Experience resolving critical customer issues Desirable attributes\n<br>Experience developing software for Microsoft Windows\n<br>Experience with secure coding best practices\n<br>Experience with Microsoft Visual Studio\n<br>Experience with Python, Ruby, or Rust\n<br><br>\n#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!</div>']
