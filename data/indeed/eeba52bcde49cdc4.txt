['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><div><p>GEMINI (www.geminimedicine.ca) is a unique big data platform in the Canadian healthcare landscape using advanced methods and analytics to extract and standardize data captured in hospital electronic health records. GEMINI currently exists at 7 hospitals, where we have collected data on over 350,000 patient visits, including approximately 1 billion data points. The GEMINI data platform supports the Ontario General Medicine Quality Improvement Network (GeMQIN), a provincial network led by Ontario Health (OH, formerly Health Quality Ontario) to improve care for general medicine hospital patients. General medicine patients represent 40% of emergency admissions to hospital and are the largest group of hospitalized patients. Over the next year, GEMINI aims to expand to the 30 largest hospitals in Ontario. Our vision is a collaborative hospital data and analytics platform to accelerate research and quality improvement for excellent hospital care.</p><p>\nWe are looking to hire a Junior Data Scientist to join the GEMINI team and help develop a truly unique data platform in the Canadian healthcare landscape. This platform would be ideally positioned to advance our understanding of COVID-19 by studying predictors and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The Junior Data Scientist role involves managing GEMINIâ€™s substantial data holdings, conducting analysis to derive insights about how to improve clinical care, and developing dynamic data visualizations for reports to front-line clinicians and hospitals. Data analysis is primarily conducted in R and this role will support a wide range of analytics focused on improving care for complex hospital patients, including biostatistical approaches as well as machine learning and natural language processing. The Junior Data Scientist will help make data meaningful for front-line healthcare providers to support quality improvement efforts, and will also be a co-author on scientific manuscripts.</p><p>\nWe are looking for a candidate with excellent programming skills, strong understanding of biostatistics and analytical methods, and an aptitude for data visualization. You will be joining a dynamic, interdisciplinary, fun and mission-driven team with various backgrounds and expertise. Strong interpersonal and communication skills will be an important asset in this role.</p><p></p><p><br>\nResponsibilities and Activities:</p><p><b>\nData Analyses (70%):</b></p><p><b>\nActivities:</b></p><ul><li>\nPerform descriptive statistical analysis in R, including but not limited to: variability, z-scores, skewness, kurtosis, confidence intervals, coefficients of variation</li><li>\nPerform inferential statistical analysis in R, including statistical tests for significance, such as null-hypothesis testing</li><li>\nManipulate, transform, and combine data from multiple R data sets to prepare for multiple study design formats, including cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, and randomized trials</li><li>\nFollow detailed study protocols and analysis plans to perform a wide variety of statistical analyses, including: multivariable modeling, multilevel hierarchical analysis, longitudinal designs (including repeated measures), propensity score analysis, prediction modeling, multiple imputation</li><li>\nConducting analysis with basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods</li><li>\nPrepare tables and patient lists to help research assistants perform manual chart review</li><li>\nProduce high quality ad hoc and standardized reports customized per study, using R procedures</li><li>\nPrepare reports for end-users, including clinicians, researchers, senior management, and hospital executives</li><li>\nPrepare appropriate data visualizations to communicate results</li><li>\nContribute to writing and reviewing manuscripts, especially methods sections</li></ul><p><b>\nData Validation and Quality Control (30%):</b></p><p><b>\nActivities:</b></p><ul><li>\nProvide support for all data operations including formatting, validating, standardization</li><li>\nPerform analyses to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data</li><li>\nValidate any output tables, listings or figures generated to ensure accuracy and reliability of analyses</li><li>\nFollow and update Standard Operating Procedures to ensure data consistency prior to analyses</li><li>\nMaintain high quality coding practices and documentation of coding</li><li>\nEfficiently identify and correct syntax and programming logic errors in R code</li></ul><p><b>\nQualifications:</b></p><ul><li>\nA Master\'s in Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Public Health or related discipline</li><li>\nAt least 3 years of relevant experience\n</li><li>Advanced knowledge in inferential statistics and data science, knowledge in clinical research/internal medicine is a plus but not necessary\n</li><li>Fully proficient in the use of R and MS Office software (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Internet Explorer, etc.)</li><li>\nExperience preparing data for varied statistical methods preferred</li><li>\nDemonstrated ability to develop software tools and support analytic operations</li><li>\nExperience with multiple study design formats preferred</li><li>\nKnowledge of Python and Perl is a plus</li><li>\nExpertise using key databases such as SQL is a plus</li><li>\nKnowledge in data science in a clinical research setting is a plus</li><li>\nExperience with working with large datasets using high-performance clusters is a plus</li><li>\nBasic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a plus</li><li>\nExcellent attention to detail and proven ability to learn new skills</li><li>\nExperience working independently and as part of a team</li><li>\nExcellent organizational skills to manage multiple tasks in a timely manner</li><li>\nDemonstrated the ability to adapt and manage changing priorities</li></ul><p></p><p><br>\nThis is a one-year contract position and is anticipated to start July 2021.</p><p></p><p><br>\n#LI-MR1</p></div></div></div>']
