The probability that a user will click on an ad is one of the most critical inputs used in ranking the ads. Similarly, the probability of interacting with the advertiser’s page is important for measuring advertiser and user satisfaction. This position is for the modeling team, which builds machine learned models for predicting such events. The team looks at all aspects of modeling including training data, features, the actual model (neural nets, linear models, decision trees etc.) and offline and online evaluation of those models.Engineers and scientistson ourteam workat the edge of machine learning and economics developing in the online stack as well as offline workflows.
