['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Who We Are\n<br>The Cloud Infrastructure Engineering team at Cisco drives the technology that\'s transforming the way IT departments secure their networks, and more importantly, their users. As a software engineer within our infrastructure team, you will be a key member of the team, which is responsible for the design, development, and operation of the platform engineering relies upon to deliver solutions to our customers. This is a small team that does big things. At its core, the Cloud infrastructure team provides Infrastructure as a Service for engineering in dozens of our “edge” data centres.\n<br>Who You\'ll Work With\n<br>This full-stack engineering team is a mix of Network, Systems, and Software Engineers who are passionate about automation and building at scale. We don\'t stop at configuration automation, we also build self-healing networks and make optimal routing adjustments based on latency 100\'s of times a day, automatically. Everything needs to scale horizontally. We take great pride in running one of the top-performing Anycast networks for DNS in the world (OpenDNS, now Umbrella). We work closely with the rest of the Security Infrastructure Engineering teams to build core Internet infrastructure, security applications and distributed systems at scale.\n<br>About you\n<br>As a member of this multi-functional team, you will work with software, network and systems engineers. Together you will help us further develop a large scale NAT as a service solution. You understand the importance of collaboration to find the best solution. You know what Linux, VxLAN, CI/CD, a network router or GRE is. You enjoy working in a DevOps environment and one of your big passions is to automate all steps between development and production. You don’t like getting pages from monitoring systems, so you expect failure and let your software automatically deal with it.\n<br><br>\n<b>Some of the things you will work on:</b><br>\nYou will help us design, build and operate the systems and APIs for a 24x7 high available and highly scalable cloud-based NAT service. This service will be used by Cisco customers to connect to Cisco’s global cloud infrastructure. There will be many interesting technical puzzles to tackle as we develop this and your skills will help us get there. Your team is responsible for the design, development, and operations of the solution. You build it, you own it. You will be part of a team that’s empowered to do what is needed to make sure this will run at scale. You won’t be working alone, there will be other teams that help you deploy this at scale on our global infrastructure. Evangelizing greatness is one of our core values so we solicit help and collaborate. Your team will work closely with other software and infrastructure engineering teams. You will learn the ins and outs of building and supporting a cloud platform running 24x7 production services. Together with our team, you will help improve the continuous integration and deployment pipelines while also working on a globally distributed infrastructure that operates at scale.\n<br>The team could be a good fit for you if several of these apply to you:\n<br>You enjoy working in a multi-functional team that owns the entire stack. You thrive in an agile environment. You are interested in building solid applications in a variety of languages (Python, Golang…). Enjoy troubleshooting systems and applications through the entire stack. You know your way around a Unix terminal and have built or deployed applications using cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud, Docker Cloud…). Love learning. Are passionate about building solutions with security in mind. Like working collaboratively with a team. You love automation. Our services are used by millions of users every day from around the world, this gets you excited. In this multi-functional team, you enjoy learning from your team members and support the learning of other team members. You are familiar with the various NAT technologies and understand how to build cloud-based services at scale.\n<br>We Are Cisco\n<br>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.\n<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us !\n<br>LI-Remote\n<br>#cie_jobs and #cie_neteng_jobs</div>']
