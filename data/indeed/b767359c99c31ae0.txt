['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><h4 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>The Company You’ll Join</b></h4>\n<p>\nAt Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.</p>\n<p>\nWe live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.</p>\n<p>\nAt Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind.
