Shareworks is the leading equity plan management solution that provides advice and services to employees and companies wherever they are in their unique financial journey. This billion-dollar-napkin has led to interesting, difficult, and unique challenges in scaling our technology, people, and processes.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nOpportunities and challenges abound as we continue to grow!</div><br>\n<div><br>\nWe provide you with a superior foundation for building a career where you can learn, achieve and grow. We believe a diverse workforce brings diversity of thought, and deepens our ability to serve our clients, investors and shareholders. We are committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging for all employees and celebrating the different cultures, perspectives and backgrounds reflected in our workforce.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nWe never turn down a reason to celebrate. We work hard and have fun along the way. Book clubs, Friday socials, team games time, hackathons, and learning hours are a part of who we are.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nYou aren\'t dogmatic; you\'re pragmatic. You know that "agile" means adapting to deliver value to customers, not necessarily any of the individual practices surrounding it. You care about automated tests and code reviews, and when the build breaks, you don\'t run git blame. You find the root cause and fix it. You embrace the hard problems like build execution speed, pipeline robustness and quality.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nYou are a developer who is not afraid of infrastructure. You identify with the “Dev” in Devops way more than the “Ops”. You live and breathe the command line. You passionately care about building the most rock-solid software delivery pipeline you have ever built.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nIt doesn\'t matter if it\'s Gradle, Groovy, Docker, Python, Ansible, Java or shell script - you know it or you can swiftly pick it up. You care about writing fast, reliable, secure, and resilient solutions for the internal customer. You partner closely with the feature developer (your customer) to understand and solve his or her pain points. You enable the developers to ship the best code possible.</div><br>\n<div><br>\nThings we believe:<br>\n<ul><li>Results matter, not the clock</li><li>We value outcome over output</li><li>Code and technology are what we use to solve problems</li></ul></div><br>\n<div><br>\nWhat you\'ll do:<br>\n<ul><li>Be customer focused – partner closely with your customers (developer) to enable her to ship the best code possible</li></ul>\n-Act technology driven - design, implement, and test new functionality<br>\n-Work closely with QA - we fix our own bugs<br>\n<ul><li>Use your experience to help the whole team get better</li></ul></div><br>\n<div><br>\nWhat you\'ll get:<br>\n<ul><li>Market rate salary based on experience</li><li>Participation in annual bonus plan</li><li>Competitve RRSP Matching</li></ul>\n-Casual Environment - we have flexible working hours and don\'t have a dress code<br>\n<ul><li>20 Paid Days off + 11 stat holidays</li><li>The occasional spontaneous Nerf War</li></ul></div></div><div></div><div><div><div><br>\n</div></div><p>\nORGANIZATION</p></div><div><div><br>\nThings we like:<br>\n<ul><li>Prior experience with large-scale software development environment</li><li>Familiarity with technologies we use (Gradle, Jenkins, Java, Docker, Ansible, Oracle, *nix command line)</li></ul>\n-A hunger for tracking down root causes - no matter how deep the rabbit hole<br>\n<ul><li>3+ years CI experience, Jenkins preferred – managing and building on the system, not just using it</li></ul>\n-3+ years Gradle experience - making a build system, not just using it<br>\n<ul><li>5+ years Java experience</li><li>Groovy experience preferred</li><li>Python experience preferred</li><li>Docker experience preferred</li><li>Oracle experience preferred</li><li>A BS in CS is appreciated but not necessary with the right background</li></ul></div><br>\n<div></div>\n<div>While we thank all applicants for their interest, please note that only those individuals selected for an interview will be contacted.</div></div></div></div>']
