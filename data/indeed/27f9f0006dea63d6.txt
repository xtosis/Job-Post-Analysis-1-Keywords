The chemicals of potential concern are a broad range of solvents and biocide metabolites.\n</p><p><b>Nature of Work:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nApproximately 80% of the post-doctoral fellow’s time will be devoted towards the development of a risk assessment approach that merges cell line, rodent and computational approaches to differentiate areas of high, medium, and low risk at a complex operating site. It will be expected to spend 20% of time on project and data management, with a key deliverable being a data submission file that compiles the data being collected across the project. The project team encompasses a variety of industrial and academic research teams, and as such the candidate will gain extensive experience in communication, coordination and decision making in a complex team environment.\n</p><p>This post-doctoral fellowship is a remote working fellowship, with the candidate not expected to travel to Saskatoon. Instead, the candidate should be prepared to work remotely for the duration of the fellowship. As such, candidates are preferred from UTC time zones -4 to -10 and will be expected to shift their work hours to match those of Saskatoon, UTC -7. The candidates should also not expect the University of Saskatchewan to provide an office or furniture. A laptop will be provided for the candidate’s use.\n</p><p><b>Typical Duties or Accountabilities:\n</b></p><ul><li>Development of risk assessment approach that merges cell line, rodent and computational approaches to differentiate areas of high, medium, and low risk at a complex operating site\n</li><li>Project and data management, with a key deliverable being a data submission file that compiles the data being collected across the project\n</li></ul><p><b>Qualifications</b></p>\n<p><b>Education:</b>\n</p><ul><li>PhD in Toxicology or Risk Assessment.</li><li>\nDemonstrated research productivity with &gt; 3 papers in recognized journals</li></ul>\n<p><b>Experience:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Familiarity with risk assessment guidelines, with preference given to candidates already familiar with the Canadian Ministers of the Environment guidelines, but other equivalent jurisdictions are also valued.\n</li><li>Demonstrated expertise in R or Python data analytic environments.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Skills:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Ability to manage and communicate across a diverse team.</li><li>\nInterest in working closely with industry to come up with workable solutions that may not directly translate to an academic publication.</li><li>\nInterest in working in an applied science team that is focussed on discovering near term solutions, rather than non-directed discovery-based research.\n</li><li>A diverse research background as this project involves soil science, veterinary medicine, aquatic ecology, systemic ecology and vascular toxicology.<br>\n</li></ul><p><br>\n<b>To Apply:</b></p>\n<ul><li>Interested applicants must include the following in their application: cover letter, curriculum vitae, any other documents you require (references, publications, etc.).</li></ul>\n<p></p>\n<h5 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>The University believes equity, diversity, and inclusion strengthen the community and enhance excellence, innovation and creativity.
