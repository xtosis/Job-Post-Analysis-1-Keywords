We create governance software that uncovers fraud, waste, and abuse easily and quickly, while having an award-winning culture and environment that rapidly develops employees. With our governance software, we’ve helped governments identify doctors that falsely diagnose patients for more money, helped organizations detect use of child labour in their supply chain, and jailed government officials that use tax money for their self-benefit. That’s impactful work!</div><div>\n</div><div>\nHeadquartered in Vancouver, Canada, with a global presence of over 475 employees, we provide a true multi-tenant, multi-region SaaS platform for our customers to govern more effectively. And as an R&amp;D member in Galvanize, you will help build our SaaS platform using Serverless AWS technologies while closely partnering with our Product and UX team members to create highly impactful solutions for our customers. We take pride in what we do, so if you want to read more about how we engineer, check out our engineering blog!</div><div></div><div><br>\nAs a Senior Software Engineer (Cloud Infrastructure), you will be instrumental at continuing to strengthen our infrastructure brigade that build and optimize the infrastructure our other brigades rely on every day. Our team operates like many others: we write code, we QA our code, and we demo at the end of each dash (a dash is like a sprint); all that differs is that they focus on the infrastructure. And no, they are not called DevOps engineers, because at Galvanize, DevOps is a culture and each brigade is ultimately responsible for their services, including being on PagerDuty.\n</div></div><div><div><h3 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>What you need to succeed</b></h3><ul><ul><li>\nExcellent understanding of AWS services and how to use them together</li><li>\nStrong ability to develop infrastructure as code - Terraform and CloudFormation are a must</li><li>\nStrong understanding of containerization (aka.
