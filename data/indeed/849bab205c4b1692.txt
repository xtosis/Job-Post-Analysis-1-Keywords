That’s where you come in. Your ingenuity will help us continue to drive innovation, making an impact on the reliability, performance, and scalability of Skip’s industry-leading technology.\n</p><div><div><div><div><p><b>The Team</b></p><div>\nOur Platform and Reliability Engineering department exists to catalyse global platform change (we currently make 5000+ changes a week) while driving commercial availability. P&amp;RE is a technical environment at an enterprise scale. Our customers are engineers (upwards of 1200), engineering leadership, business and product stakeholders - all distributed globally.</div><p></p><div><br>\nOur microservices platform requires strong ownership from the engineering teams, including accountability for choice, design and support of their data stores.</div><p></p><div><br>\nYou’ll run a small team in Canada building global services for our Global platforms. You’ll work alongside a UK data infrastructure engineering team, working to the same vision and roadmap.</div><p></p><div><br>\nThat’s where we come in - even though the engineering teams own their own data stores that back their features, we engineer tools and services to help them go faster while being super reliable. Be that moving data around the world or tooling/services we’ve built to keep data secure, reliable, available, and accurate. Plus, we’re designing and engineering the architecture and services that will ensure we can recover from a disaster should the need arise. We have to ensure our hungry customers can always get the food they want whenever they need it!</div><p></p><p><b><br>\nThe Individual</b></p><div>\nYou should have strong software engineering skills and the ability to solve complex problems with automation, tooling, and technology. You should have substantial experience in building solutions with AWS technologies. Familiarity of how different database technologies work would be advantageous.

The role is engineering-focused and requires building services that remove pain from the product engineering teams. They want to focus on product, not data infrastructure. Our goal is to ensure that data exists wherever required for reliability, compliance, and security. Our engineering teams utilise the gamut of data storage mechanisms in AWS and beyond; therefore, we must build innovative solutions to meet our requirements.</div><p></p><div><br>\nNo two days are ever the same, and there are always interesting technical problems to solve. The role involves liaising with key stakeholders and management peers to strategize and design high-quality, robust technology products that are resilient to failure. You will also manage high-performing engineers and help them to be their best. This is a hands-on role where you will be working with the rest of the team building solutions and solving technical challenges.</div><p></p><div><b><br>\nKey Features of the Role</b></div><ul><li><div>\nBe a trusted technical authority and evangelist in building services with AWS technologies</div></li><li><div>\nDefining and owning a strong roadmap to meet commercial and engineering requirements</div></li><li><div>\nManaging stakeholders at all levels including your Senior Tech Manager, and the Head of Platform Engineering</div></li><li><div>\nCarry out recruitment &amp; induction processes</div></li><li><div>\nManaging and motivating a distributed team, including mentoring, development and performance management</div></li><li><div>\nDay to day management of work (Scrum, Kanban or similar)</div></li><li><div>\nA data driven approach to prioritisation</div></li><li><div>\nDelivering tooling to wide ranging customers and evidence of Product led feedback and enhancements</div></li><li><div>\nDepartment level planning: owning planning of projects, breaking them down into deliverable chunks, identifying and managing dependencies</div></li><li><div>\nAble to solve complex problems and take a new perspective on existing solutions.</div></li><li><div>\nCollaborate with other product development teams and use their feedback as a basis for improvements to our products</div></li><li><div>\nEmbrace, champion and influence best practices for engineering analysis and design</div></li><li><div>\nDefine and meet service level objectives for services in your care</div></li><li><div>\nCollaborate with a wide variety of talented engineers to help them build reliable and scalable services</div></li></ul><p></p><div><b><br>\nKnowledge &amp; Experience</b></div><p></p><ul><li><div><br>\n3+ years experience managing a cross-functional engineering team</div></li><li><div>\n3+ years building enterprise-scale solutions with Amazon Web Services</div></li><li><div>\n3+ years of experience writing enterprise-grade object-oriented Python apps using libraries such as Boto3, Pytest, Moto, and Pydantic.</div></li><li><div>\nExperience working in a Continuous Delivery cycle using CI/CD tooling and enterprise software management tools such as Github, Ansible and Jira.</div></li><li><div>\nWorking with a microservices architecture</div></li><li><div>\nAptitude to get up to speed with new technologies quickly</div></li><li><div>\nKeen interest and ability to analyse systems for scalability and reliability</div></li><li><div>\nStrong analytical and troubleshooting skills</div></li><li><div>\nGood team communication skills</div></li><li><div>\nSuperior written communication skills</div></li><li><div>\nAbility to prioritise tasks and work independently</div></li><li><div>\nA passion for providing excellent service to developers and external customers</div></li></ul><p></p><div><b><br>\nIt will be a plus if you have any of the following...</b></div><p></p><ul><li><div><br>\nSolid understanding of any of the following database products: MySQL, SQL Server, DynamoDB, RDS (inc.
