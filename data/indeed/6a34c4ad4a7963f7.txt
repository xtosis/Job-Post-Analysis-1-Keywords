It has grown by offering people simple, effective home search, augmented with relevant real estate data to empower better decision making.</p>\n<p>\nBut REW is more than REW.ca, it\'s a team of creative people, driven to improve the property process, one digital experience at a time.</p>\n<p>\nVision for the role</p>\n<p>\nData is at the heart of everything we do at REW. Every day, our data platform ingests feeds from dozens of sources to compile, composite, and augment the inventory of listings that the thousands of REW users search in their quest for the perfect home. Our listings need to be accurate, comprehensive, and highly available - or our users will go elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\nListings are only part of the puzzle.
