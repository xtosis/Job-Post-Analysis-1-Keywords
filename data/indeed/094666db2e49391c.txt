As anyone can tell you, with fast and significant growth comes growing pains and due to that, in the past we have experienced our share of changes.</p><p>\nTransformation is the one constant in the automotive industry and AutoCanada is no exception to that. Where we are exceptional however, is that we are a company who takes a chance on inexperience over technical prowess if that inexperience comes with strength of character and work ethic.

A company where loyalty and perseverance are rewarded, and where investing in our people is the greatest investment of them all.</p><p>\nWe are in pursuit of an elite team to take our publicly traded, Canadian-born and raised company, to the next level in automotive excellence and, as the exciting industry of automotive continues to evolve, our story, and that of our 4,200 team members, will continue to transform.</p><p>\nFor more information about AutoCanada we invite you to visit www.autocan.ca, @AutoCanada or www.facebook.com/autocan/.
