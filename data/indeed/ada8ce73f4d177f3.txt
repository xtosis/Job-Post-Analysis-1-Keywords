['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><h2 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>A Moving Experience.\n</b></h2><p>Opportunity: develop voice driven applications to use inside the car, using Cerence tools and technologies to prepare data to train neural network based engines, run regression tests, fix bugs and interact with upstream/downstream teams. This requires the candidate to work with data to train the statistical models, in order to induce an expected behavior, as well as checking the final behavior to validate expectations in a suit of regression tests. This requires following a process used to develop NLU applications, which includes a bug fixing process with a QA team.\n<br>\n<br>\nDaily Functions / Responsibilities: a typical day will have the successful candidate working on NLU resources to train machine learning models, using the Cerence developed tools and processes. These resources are versioned in a GIT respository, and once complete, the models can be trained and regression tests can be run to assess quality. Once models are delivered, a quality assurance team provides feedback, which then is used to improve accuracy for the next deliverable.\n<br>\n<br>\nRequirements:\n</p><ul><li>Education: Computer Science or related undergrad studies.\n</li><li>Understanding of machine learning techniques applied to natural language understanding. Knowledge of compilers theory is an asset.\n</li><li>Programming languages: Python (preferred), or another object oriented language such as C++, Java or C#.\n</li><li>Knowledge of POSIX systems, GIT (or similar versioning systems) and proficient using command line tools.\n</li><li>Knowledge o JIRA is an asset.\n</li></ul><p>Skills:\n</p><ul><li>Motivated and curious to learn.\n</li><li>Team player.\n</li><li>Good communication.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>Cerence Inc.
