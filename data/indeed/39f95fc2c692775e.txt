The existing web application is built on the Django framework (Python, MS SQL) and consolidates molecular testing results from across the province and supports rapid access to data for outbreak response teams in all areas of BC, and provides reporting for Ministry of Health leadership. Data are drawn from multiple heterogeneous systems, wrangled into a coherent schema, and provided to users based on role by web and programmatic interfaces. We are expanding our testing capabilities to include high-throughput whole genome sequencing for fine-grained understanding of outbreak dynamics. This testing requires significant support for laboratory technologists, and integration with external computational assets.\n</p><p></p><p>In this position you will develop software systems to support the British Columbia response to the COVID-19 pandemic. You will build and extend interacting systems primarily built on the Django framework. This work includes some software support for existing applications but primarily will involve building a new system for tracking laboratory artifacts for rapid response whole genome sequencing. This includes end user interfaces, and integration with our compute cluster using REST APIs for the complex steps in whole genome sequencing. You will bring your software expertise to assist in evaluating third-party software that may form part of the solution.\n</p><p></p><p>We offer a rare opportunity to work with cutting edge scientists and technologists to serve the public good in the on-going COVID-19 emergency.
