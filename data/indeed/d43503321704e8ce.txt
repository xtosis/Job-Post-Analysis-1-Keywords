Who You Are\n<br>You are a developer with a passion for design. You understand it isn’t about having code that works but having beautifully written code that produces a sophisticated user experience. You might have been born wanting to code or the desire found you later in life; subsequently teaching yourself to code. You love improving the efficiency and quality of code and are driven to learn. Staying on top of fast-moving trends in web development is likely a hobby!

Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br><br>\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br><br>\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br><br>\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!</div>']
