Team members develop and test features, support feature and system testing done by other teams, automate component and feature testing, and deliver software in a continuous integration framework.

At least 12 months of relevant software development experience, preferably in networking and/or embedded applications. Work terms in university will be considered, if relevant. A high degree of proficiency with C or C++. Experience and proficiency with Python. A high degree of proficiency with real-time concepts and embedded software development concepts.

Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br><br>\nBut “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br><br>\nDay to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br><br>\nSo, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!</div>']
