Verify and validate.</div><div></div><div><b><br>\nCommunicate openly and respectfully: </b>Offer and expect transparency to build trust. Confirm mutual understanding, especially in the face of disagreement. Treat each other with respect.

Trust each other and take risks together. Give praise generously and take joy in others’ accomplishments. Grow a diverse team by actively seeking different backgrounds and cultivating an inclusive culture. Focus on how others’ strengths compliment us, rather than how their weaknesses invalidate them.</div></div></div></div>']
