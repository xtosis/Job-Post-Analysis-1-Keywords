In November 2020, UBC successfully went live with its new HR and Finance implementation of Workday. The Integrated Renewal Program (IRP) is now focused on the journey to renew the Student information ecosystem, anchored by the implementation of Workday Student.\n</p><p></p><p>The Integrated Renewal Program—Student (IRP Student) vision is to transform the way UBC supports learning and research, and how UBC works, to create a cohesive, integrated, and enriched experience for students, staff, and faculty. This implementation will result in superior support for UBC students, a better user experience, a new set of tools, a new way of working, and improved reporting for informed decision-making. IRP Student will leverage the industry-leading cloud enterprise solution Workday to replace our current core Student administration systems with a new integrated, user friendly, mobile-enabled platform.\n</p><p></p><p>For more information on the IRP Student, please visit www.integrated-renewal.ubc.ca\n</p><p></p><p>The Test Automation Engineer will implement test automation across all domains relating to Workday functional, Ecosystems, and/or Integration.
