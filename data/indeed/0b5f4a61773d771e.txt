Applicants who apply to an inventory process may be referred for one or more opportunities if they meet the needs of the position identified for staffing. Management can decide to access applications at any point so please ensure you submit your application as soon as possible.<br>\n<br>\nHow can you apply?<br>\nWe want to attract top talent. Therefore we are focusing more on your competencies that complement your knowledge.\n<br>\nWe are also taking a simplified approach for you to apply to this process. To apply for this process:<br>\n<ul><li>provide your resume (no cover letter needed)</li><li>answer the screening questions</li></ul><br>\nWhen you apply you will be asked a series of screening questions based on the education and experience criteria below. When answering the screening questions, please provide:<br>\n<ul><li>Concrete and detailed examples to demonstrate how you meet the qualifications;</li><li>Where, when and how the experience was acquired.</li></ul><br>\nWe can’t make any assumptions about your experience. Simply saying you have the required qualifications or listing your current duties is not enough. We’ll only use your résumé as a secondary source of information. The depth and breadth of experience of an applicant may be considered as part of screening or selection of a candidate, which is why it is recommended you quantify your experience. The screening questions are the primary source of information the screening board may use and your resume may only be used as a secondary source to verify information.<br>\n<br>\nWe will only accept on-line applications received via the Public Service Jobs site. Apart from general inquiries, further documentation and applications emailed to the poster contact will not be accepted.
