['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><div><p>We are Accenture — a global professional services organization, which includes being a vital services partner to the world’s major cloud providers — ServiceNow, AWS, Azure, Google, and others. Demand for their offerings — and for ours — skyrocketed last year as the Covid-19 pandemic rolled on. Organizations had to grapple with the sudden dispersal of their workforces and supply chains.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>To meet that surging demand we consolidated our far-flung cloud-related skill sets into one highly-focused services group, named Accenture Cloud First. It started out last September with 70,000 cloud professionals, a number that’s growing rapidly. (Accenture’s total employee population exceeds 500,000.) Accenture Cloud First is on a mission that has a $3 billion/three-year investment behind it.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>Learn more about our ServiceNow at Accenture Here</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Accenture’s ServiceNow practice</b> can help any organization determine how to best respond to changing business needs and coordinate services across the enterprise for greater speed, agility and efficiency, all delivered at scale.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>For now, all Accenture business travel, international and domestic, is currently restricted to client-essential sales/delivery activity only.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>Please note: The safety and well-being of our people continues to be the top priority, and our decisions around travel are informed by government COVID-19 response directives, recommendations from leading health authorities and guidance from a number of infectious disease experts.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Job Description</b></p>\n<ul><li>Lead consulting engagements from post sales stage to successful delivery of the project in terms of scope, deliverables, budget, client satisfaction and achievement of required business outcomes.</li>\n<li>Manage all aspects of project delivery and solution delivery</li>\n<li>Lead and manage the implementation project team</li>\n<li>Prepare all client facing and internal deliverables such as project plan, issues/risk register and weekly status reports</li>\n<li>Identify opportunities to provide additional value to our clients and to work internally with the ServiceNow account teams to progress</li>\n<li>Drive the continuous improvements of our implementation methodology and service offerings based on client experiences</li>\n<li>Proven experience of leading the deployment of Enterprise Software (ideally ITIL related) solutions in client environments</li>\n<li>Strong background working with Enterprise Software companies and/or Consulting companies</li>\n<li>Demonstrated ability to influence and consult (providing options with pros, cons and risks) while providing thought leadership to sponsors/stakeholders in solving governance, program/project management, business process and/or technical problems</li></ul></div>\n<br>\n<div><p><b>Basic Qualifications</b></p>\n<ul><li>Minimum 5 years knowledge and experience working with or implementing ServiceNow</li>\n<li>ServiceNow System Administrator Certification or in depth ServiceNow experience</li>\n<li>Experience with MS Project</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills (both written and verbal) with strong presentation and facilitation skills</li>\n<li>Project Management/Delivery experience or certification in project management</li>\n<li>Bachelor\'s degree or equivalent (minimum 12 years) work experience.
