['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">Build and lead a world-class devops culture in our corporate information systems team. We are looking to raise the bar on traditional IS globally, establishing a new approach to application management that is truly multi-cloud and hybrid cloud oriented, built on Kubernetes with Python operations code. We are taking \'infra-as-code\' to the next level and aim to set an example that our customers - many of the largest brands in the world - can follow with confidence.\n<br><br>\nThis is an opportunity for a strong engineering director with devops interests to lead the next wave of open source in the enterprise.\n<br><br>\nWorking with engineering director colleagues across our product and operations teams, lead a global team focused on the business workloads - open source and proprietary - that make Ubuntu, Canonical, and our various services highly available around the planet. From public cloud to private cloud and micro cloud, from the most basic internal capability to our most high profile public services, our devops team are a critical part of the business.\n<br><br>\nTraditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.\n<br><br>\nYou will set the vision and lead by example in creating, maintaining and evangelizing product grade Python Kubernetes operators for these workloads. Building a culture of quality software engineering, with full automation of every aspect in the software lifecycle, you will set the pace for devops internally, in our managed services, and for our customers. Your team will design, develop, test and operate the application management codebase for a large portfolio of workloads that we offer customers. You will set the standard for CI/CD in operations code.\n<br><br>\nThe IS team at Canonical supports and maintains the services of over 60 million Ubuntu users. The team brings real operational experience to product development teams, ensuring that our offerings are battle-tested and ready for customer deployment.\n<br><br>\n<b>The successful candidate will be multi-talented, with:</b><br>\nExperience in Kubernetes operations and the cloud-native landscape\n<br><br>\nA technical or science background and qualifications\n<br><br>\nSoftware engineering experience as an individual contributor\n<br><br>\nExperience developing and leading engineering talent\n<br><br>\nStrong organizational skills and the ability to balance multiple priorities\n<br><br>\nA desire to collaborate with development teams to improve products\n<br><br>\nExcellent communication skills\n<br><br>\nThe ability to present to senior leadership, both internal and external\n<br><br>\nA strong work ethic, and personal interests aligned with the field\n<br><br>\nIf you have a passion for software engineering and devops, experience in cloud-native technologies, a deep interest in Kubernetes, and both leadership and organisational skills, then you will love this role.\n<br><br>\nCanonical is a growing international software company that works with the open source community to deliver Ubuntu, "the world\'s best free software platform". Our mission is to release the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organizations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.</div>']
