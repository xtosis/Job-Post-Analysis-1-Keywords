Serverless computing offers customers an exciting new way to create applications, turn business logic and application code into scalable, fault-tolerant production without requiring them to be experts in , deployment technologies, and infrastructure management.\n<br><br>\nSwitchboard is a new organization within Lambda that aims to provide tools for service owners to onboard their own event sources to Lambda. Becoming a supported event source allows service owners to help their customers manage events being sent to Lambda. We aim to reduce the effort to onboard to Lambda to 0. Lambda supports only a handful of event sources today; with Switchboard, we will open the ecosystem for anyone to become a partner. Imagine thousands of services - internal and external - as supported Lambda event sources.\n<br><br>\nThis is a brand-new space with lots of room to grow. If you\'re interested in defining new ideas, and bringing them to market, this is a great place to be. We are literally in Day One of our product, and we are the next evolution of what Lambda will become. Interested in being part of the next generation defining "computing"? Come chat with us!\n<br><br>\nWhy would you want to join our team?\n<br>If you are passionate about solving hard technical problems in the space and want your work to make an immediate impact in the real world, this is the place for you. We solve problems on par with leading academic research for the benefit of customers who celebrate our feature launches on social media, constantly demand new features, and - through adoption - force us to invent new ways to scale our . If going deep to optimize for scale, latency, and resource usage excites you as much as working backwards from the customer to features that not only work, but delight, then join us in making Lambda the most successful compute platform on the planet!\n<br><br>\nWhat does it take to succeed in this role?\n<br>In addition to meeting the technical qualifications, you need to be creative, responsible, and able to dig deep into emerging technologies. Willing to read research papers, but also move quickly to turn ideas into code that solves customer problems. You should be excited (and a little frightened!) by the enormous scale at which we operate. A natural problem solver, who wants to understand business problems, operational issues, and software architecture, and how all three connect. Curious about our customers\' needs and dedicated to turning developers into raving fans. Excited to learn from others while bringing your own novel capabilities and perspectives. Someone who makes the team room both productive and fun to work in.\n<br><br>\nIf this is you, come help us and work with industry leaders to tackle exciting large-scale problems in a quickly evolving environment that is defining the future of software architecture.\n<br><br>\nLambda is seeing an adoption rate on par with when AWS launched EC2. It\'s exciting times with a lot of room to grow.\n<br><br>\n<b>Inclusive Team Culture:</b> Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion.
