['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText">What\'s Bench? Check us out in Medium , Betakit, Financial Post , Fintech Impact , Perkins + Will , BC Business , our Instagram , and our Blog.\n<br><br>\nWe acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.\n<br><br>\nOur mission is to make a profound difference in the quality of life of one million people, by removing the financial complexity of entrepreneurship. Businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses.\n<br><br>\nBench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. Learn more about us on our About page.\n<br><br>\nWe\'re growing fast, and we\'re looking for you to join us on this incredible journey.\n<br><br>\nWhat does the Data team look like?\n<br><br>\nAt Bench, the Data team encompasses the full gamut of business intelligence and data analytics activities. We are responsible for creating and maintaining the infrastructure that gets analysts and leadership across the company the information they need. We do this by developing and maintaining data pipelines, a data warehouse, and visualization tools, and by leading the adoption of new technology and practices to improve the lives of our data consumers. We also ensure that our data infrastructure is fit-for-purpose by using it ourselves as analysts for our Product team, and by filling any gaps in reporting and analysis that aren\'t covered by analysts elsewhere in the company.\n<br><br>\n<b>What you\'ll be getting up to:</b><br>\nListen to requests from analysts or business partners, deeply understand their needs, and translate those needs into requirements for data products\n<br>Write analytic queries that transform raw data from source systems into business facts and metrics\n<br>Review queries, scripts, and visualizations produced by other analysts to ensure consistent accuracy and quality\n<br>Produce presentations, dashboards, and self-service tools to make data accessible to and understandable by everyone at Bench\n<br>Participate in planning and prioritization of work to be done by the Data team\n<br>Protect our clients and colleagues by maintaining security and access control over our data\n<br>Learn about emerging or established data technologies and evaluate whether Bench can benefit from their adoption\n<br><br>\n<b>To be successful in this role, you\'ll need to have:</b><br>\n<b>SQL proficiency :</b> Writing, debugging, and reviewing queries that make heavy use of analytics functionality (complex aggregations, window functions, common table expressions) and that operate on many rows of data is a daily occurrence in this role.\n<br><b>Data visualization and storytelling:</b> We create value when the things we build are being used. For us, that often means that data is translated into useful insights using a BI tool (eg. Tableau, Power BI), or even an effective graph or dashboard in Excel/Google Sheets.\n<br><b>Technical written and verbal communication :</b> At Bench, analytics engineers need to interface at all levels of the organization: From going deep on technical details with fellow analysts, to explaining results to business partners, to forming recommendations for senior leadership. You possess effective written and verbal communication skills at a wide range of complexity and detail.\n<br><b>Responsibility:</b> Our success depends on building trust - both among teammates and with stakeholders. To maintain that trust, we expect each other to make commitments, to keep those commitments, and to hold ourselves to account for those commitments.\n<br><b>Curiosity and a drive to learn:</b> We become better analysts and technologists by learning: From our stakeholders, we learn about what\'s important to them and to the business (what should we do and why should we do it?); from our analytical colleagues and the wider industry, we learn about practices and tools that help us improve (how should we do it?).\n<br><br>\n<b>It could be an even better fit if you have:</b><br>\n<b>Familiarity with version control systems :</b> We source-control our analytics code to ensure that metrics are consistent, no matter who pulls the data. Comfort with the feature branch Git workflow model will help you understand how logic gets "promoted to production".\n<br><b>Architectural and systems thinking:</b> Modularity and abstraction are important to us so that we can build analyses and tools that are consistent and repeatable. You can break down a complicated problem into pieces, identify when the same piece is needed in many different places, and find a general solution that makes our future lives easier.\n<br><b>Nose for Value:</b> Not all requests are created equal. You know how to use your time effectively to commit just the right amount of effort to those requests, and you keep it within the bounds of your working day. Overtime is cheating!\n<br><br>\n<b>Extra bonus points if you have:</b><br>\nExposure to AWS services useful for data analytics (eg. Redshift, Glue, Data Pipeline, DMS, Lambda)\n<br>Exposure to workflow orchestration tools (eg. Airflow, Prefect, Luigi)\n<br>Familiarity with Agile/Scrum methodologies\n<br>Previous experience in SaaS growth, product, or marketing analytics\n<br><br>\n<b>The extra details:</b><br>\nThis is a full-time permanent position because we want to spend lots of time with your wonderful self!\n<br>This position offers an annual salary, stock options, and an extended benefits package that includes health, dental, and vision.\n<br>All Benchmates have access to Inkblot Therapy , our virtual counselling service to support mental wellbeing, and Bravely , our confidential, on-demand, 1:1 professional coaching service.\n<br><br>\nOur salary band for this role is between $68,800-$86,000. We\'ve recently made a change to our compensation process - learn more about why and what practices we\'re putting in place here .\n<br>Our office has gone fully remote! We\'ll set you up with everything you need to work from home, from day one.\n<br><br>\nWe believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don\'t stand for tokenism. We stand for representation.</div>']
