['<div id="jobDescriptionText" class="jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"><p>We are Accenture — a global professional services organization, which includes being a vital services partner to the world’s major cloud providers — ServiceNow, AWS, Azure, Google, and others. Demand for their offerings — and for ours — skyrocketed last year as the Covid-19 pandemic rolled on. Organizations had to grapple with the sudden dispersal of their workforces and supply chains.<br>\n<br>\nTo meet that surging demand, we consolidated our far-flung cloud-related skill sets into one highly-focused services group, named Accenture Cloud First. It started out last September with 70,000 cloud professionals, a number that’s growing rapidly. (Accenture’s total employee population exceeds 500,000.)<br>\n<br>\nLearn more about our ServiceNow at Accenture Here<br>\n<br>\nJob Description<br>\nWithin the ServiceNow group, the implementation specialist is needed to be responsible for the successful delivery of ServiceNow solutions and services in a client consulting environment.<br>\n<br>\nFor now, all Accenture business travel, international and domestic, is currently restricted to client-essential sales/delivery activity only.<br>\n<br>\nPlease note: The safety and well-being of our people continues to be the top priority, and our decisions around travel are informed by government COVID-19 response directives, recommendations from leading health authorities and guidance from a number of infectious disease experts.</p>\n<br>\n<div><div><b>Basic Qualifications:</b><br>\n<ul><li>Minimum 2+ Years\' experience with ServiceNow Implementations</li><li>Minimum 2+ Years\' experience of experience in JavaScript or related application development</li><li>Minimum 2+ Years of experience with Application Experience: Incident, Problem, Change Management, Knowledge, Service Catalog</li></ul></div><ul><li>Ability to plan, solution, develop, and test Working Product as part of an Agile/Scrum Development Team</li><li>Bachelor\'s degree or equivalent (minimum 12 years) work experience.
